/*
** Welcome to Narcoleptic. This library allows you to dramatically reduce
** the power consumption of your Arduino project.
**
** Whilst in a Narcoleptic delay, the CPU current consumption drops from
** around 15mA down to about 7ÂµA.
**
** Note that Narcoleptic only shuts down the CPU. It does not shut down
** anything else consuming current - LEDs, or the USB to serial chip.
** For low current applications, consider using boards without those,
** such as the Sparkfun Arduino Pro with the power LED removed.
**
** The original version of Narcoleptic was available on: http://narcoleptic.googlecode.com
** Various forks can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/search?q=narcoleptic

/* To use Narcoleptic, you will need the following line. Arduino will
** auto-insert it if you select Sketch > Import Library > Narcoleptic. */
